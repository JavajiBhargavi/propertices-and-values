    <h1>Charminar</h1>
    <p>The Charminar is situated on the east bank of Musi River.[5] To the west lies the Laad Bazaar, and to the southwest the richly ornamented Makkah Masjid.[6] It is listed as an archaeological and architectural treasure on the official list of monuments prepared by the Archaeological Survey of India.[7] The English name is a translation and combination of the Urdu words chƒÅr and minar, translating to "Four Pillars"; the towers are ornate minarets attached and supported by four grand arches.[6]</p>
